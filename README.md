# Traffic Optimizer

## Overview
**Traffic Optimizer** is a cutting-edge web application engineered to transform urban commuting, particularly within Nigeria's dynamic traffic landscape. Forget the stress of congestion; our platform empowers users to discover optimal routes for a smoother, more efficient journey.

Featuring a futuristic "Liquid Glass" design inspired by iOS 26, Traffic Optimizer combines powerful mapping and routing technologies with an intuitive user experience.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Mapping:** Visualize your routes on a dynamic map powered by **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** and rendered with **Leaflet.js**.
* **Intelligent Route Optimization:** Get the fastest routes with estimated travel times and distances, thanks to the robust **Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)** API.
* **Smart Address Search:** Easily find your starting point and destination with a powerful autocomplete feature, leveraging **Nominatim** for accurate location data.
* **Real-time Insights (Simulated):** The application provides indicators for "possible congestion" and "traffic trends" based on route analysis and historical data caching.
* **User-Friendly Alerts:** Stay informed with timely notifications for route selection, errors, and system status.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones, thanks to **Bootstrap 5**.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3 (with custom "Liquid Glass" styling)
    * JavaScript
    * **Bootstrap 5:** For responsive layout and UI components.
    * **jQuery & jQuery UI:** For interactive elements and address autocomplete.
* **Mapping & Routing APIs:**
    * **Leaflet.js:** Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
    * **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** Provides the underlying map data.
    * **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine):** Handles route calculation and optimization.
    * **Nominatim:** Used for geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates) and providing autocomplete suggestions.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter your Starting Point** in the first input field.
2.  **Enter your Destination** in the second input field. As you type, address suggestions powered by Nominatim will appear. Select the correct one.
3.  Click the "**Find Optimal Route**" button.
4.  The map will display the calculated routes, and various route options with estimated times, distances, and simulated traffic statuses will be shown.
5.  Click "Select Route" on any listed option to view its path highlighted on the map.

# Traffic Optimizer: Liquid Glass Commute

## Project Overview

**Traffic Optimizer** is a client-side web application built to address the challenges of urban commuting in regions like Nigeria, where traffic optimization can significantly improve daily travel. It provides an intuitive interface for users to find efficient routes between two points, incorporating a modern "Liquid Glass" aesthetic.

While currently leveraging a heuristic for "congestion" and "trend" based on OSRM's estimated duration and a local cache, this project lays the groundwork for integration with real-time traffic data in future iterations.

## Features

* **Route Calculation:** Utilizes OSRM to find the fastest driving routes between specified origin and destination.
* **Geocoding & Autocomplete:** Implements Nominatim for robust address search and auto-completion, enhancing user input efficiency.
* **Interactive Map Display:** Routes are visualized on an OpenStreetMap base layer via Leaflet.js.
* **UI/UX:** Responsive design with Bootstrap 5 and a distinct "Liquid Glass" visual theme, aiming for a modern and engaging user experience.
* **Local Caching:** Basic historical caching of route durations to provide simulated "trend" analysis.

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery)
* **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    * **Bootstrap 5:** Frontend framework for responsive layout and styling.
    * **Leaflet.js:** Interactive mapping library.
    * **jQuery UI:** Specifically used for the autocomplete functionality.
* **APIs Consumed:**
    * **Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM):** For route geometry, duration, and distance calculations.
    * **Nominatim:** For geocoding and reverse geocoding services.
    * **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** Provides the base map tiles.
